    "This project consists of classification models to identify water pump functionality in Tanzania. Limited access to safe water is a major health risk. These models are potential tools for government agencies or non-governmental organizations to identify areas with limited access to clean water. Through an iterative modeling process, we produced a model that predicted pump functionality with 85% accuracy. By identifying non-functional water pumps, organizations can divert resources to areas in need of assistance and improve water access and health in Tanzania."

In doing so, we trained our model with the focus of identifying 'non functional' water pumps. These non-functional pumps represent areas that require the most maintenance in pump infrastructure. Any organization addressing access to water needs to prioritize its resources and understand where to send personnel and materials.

Therefore we've defined 'non functional' as the \"positive\" case for these precision and recall scores. Recall was the more important metric. In this scenario, recall measures how many non-functional pumps our models are able to detect out of all the non-functional pumps in the dataset. 'False negatives' (i.e. classified 'functional' when it is actually 'non functional') represent a greater risk to water access as pumps that are in need of attention could get overlooked if misclassified by the model. \n",

    "Out of our three models, the KNN model has the highest recall score for the 'non functional' category at 0.741. This means that for the test data, it correctly classified 74.1% of non-functional pumps out of all true non-functional pumps in the dataset.The other two models have recall scores within 1-2%: Bagging had a recall score of 0.738 and Random Forest had a recall score of 0.726.\n",

    "In choosing a best model, we wanted to take both accuracy and recall into account. Overall, Bagging is our best model with an accuracy score of 0.850 and a recall score of 0.738. The low recall score is a feature we'd like to address if we continued to improve on this model in the future. Given that the precision score for these models is higher than the recall scores, there is room for a tradeoff between recall and precision. Increasing sensitivity to non-functional pumps would improve recall and reduce the number of 'false negatives'. \n",
    "\n",
    "One possible way to do this is to adjust the probability threshold for determining a non-functional class to tune the model's sensitivity to the 'non functional' class. This would cause models to favor the non-functional class, driving up the sensitivity to non-functional pumps. While this comes at a cost of correctly detecting functional pumps, the health benefits of identiying and fixing non-functional pumps is a strong reason to justify this tradeoff. A precision vs recall curve could be used to determine an ideal threshold to balance the tradeoff."

    "After iterating over several models and model types, we developed a Bagging classifier to determine a water pump's functionality based on regional information, management and installation information, water quality and amount, and pump characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our best performing model is a BaggingClassifier with DecisionTreeClassifiers as the base estimator. This model had an accuracy score of 0.850, meaning it correctly classified a pump's functional status 85% of the time. Our best model was limited in its sensitivity towards the non-functional class. While it correctly classified 73.8% of all non-functional cases, the model still has room for improvement. Improving the model's recall for non-functional water pumps would improve its efficacy in identifying places where people lack access to clean water. The top feature importances for the model were all related to 'installer', the organization/individual responsible for installing the water pump. This indicates that 'installer' has some implications in predicting a pump's functionality and highlights pump installation as a possible area for organizations to investigate.\n",

    "This model is a tool for organizations seeking to improve water access in Tanzania. Due to the limited data available on the age of each water pump, our model could be used when age data is not readily available and look at other features in order to classify pump funtionality. Both government agencies and non-governmental organizations could use the model to where pumps are non-functional and provide aid to people who are unable to access safe sources of water. \n",

    "- Reduce model complexity: We highlighted age as a feature where information is lacking. The model currently takes in 17 features. Given the challenge of collecting information to feed into the model, a model that can make predictions when less infomation is available could be more useful for organizations to utilize. The challenge is to balance model performance with reduced complexity/information availability.\n",
